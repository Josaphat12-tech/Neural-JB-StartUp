# Neural-JB-StartUp
This A Multi-Class Brain Tumor Classifier using Convolutional Neural Network with 99% Accuracy achieved by applying the method of Transfer Learning using Python and Pytorch Deep Learning Framework. It can accurately identify brain tumors in medical images by fine-tuning a pre-trained CNN model on a labeled dataset of brain MRI images.
